# Educational Webhosting

Nowadays in Europe you get a powerful webserver for 3€ per month ([e.g. from scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/arm-instances/)). You could also get half a year of free google server, but why bother switching after the free trial period if you can get something for just 3€. With proper configuration the server includes:

- unlimited emails
- webhosting
- cloud storage

Maybe every citizen should be sponsored with a free web server? ;-)

This repository contains a nodejs server-script that enables easy-to-use static hosting, mainly intended for usage by pupils in an educational context. Without registration, without emails, without advertising.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/adabru/educational-webhosting.git
cd educational-webhosting
node server.js
```
